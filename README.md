# SF-Curves
SFML-based library to draw curves.

## What it does:
- Provides interface for Bézier curves;
- Implements Square- and Cubic curves;
- Provides debug-friendly features like "helper lines" etc.

## What it doesn't do (yet):
- Classes do not inherit sf::Shape;
- Curves other than Bézier ones;
- Any other shape;

## Usage:
Copy SFC directory to your project and use like any other .cpp/.hpp files.

[Separate compilation and dynamic linking aren't ready yet]
