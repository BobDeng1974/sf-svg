# SF-Curves
SFML-based library to draw curves.

## What it does:
- Classes inherit sf::Shape;
- Implements Square- and Cubic curves;
- Provides interface for Bézier curves;
- Provides debug-friendly features like "helper lines" etc.

## What it lacks (yet):
- Curves other than Bézier ones;
- Some parts of documentation.

## Documentation
You can find docs [here](https://koczurekk.github.io/QSFML/).<br />
Generated using doxygen, It's not good-looking, but I don't have time to change doxygen's .css files.

## Usage:
Copy SFC directory to your project and use like any other .cpp/.hpp files.

[Separate compilation and dynamic linking aren't ready yet]
